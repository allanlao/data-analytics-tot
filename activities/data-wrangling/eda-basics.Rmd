# Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns, to spot anomalies, to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations

#EDA Key Terms

Before you begin exploratory data analysis, it's important to understand a few key terms:



-  **Value**: A data value is a piece of information, such as a number or a date.

- **Variable**: A data variable is a characteristic that you can measure, such as weight or income.

- **Distribution**: The distribution of a dataset is how the dataset is spread out. You can visualize a dataset's   distribution by observing its shape on a graph.
- **Outlier**: An outlier is a data value that is significantly different, including much higher or lower, from the rest of a dataset.
- **Data model**: A data model is a method of organizing data and relationships between values in a dataset.

# Know your data

The first step to conducting exploratory data analysis is to observe your dataset at a high level. Start by determining the size of your dataset, including how many rows and columns it has. This can help you predict any future issues you might have with your data.

---

```{r include=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(hflights)
library(tidyverse)

```
# The hflights Dataset
Includes data on all flights that departed **Houston, TX in 2011**

```{r}
df <- as.data.frame(hflights)

str(df)
```

>There are 227496 observations; 21 variables

# The hflights Dataset
```{r}
knitr::kable(
    head(df, 10),format = 'html'
)
```

- **Categorical data** describes the data that fits into the categories.
  ex. (Gender , Country)
  
- **Quantitative data** is also known as numerical data which represents the numerical value (i.e., how much, how often, how many). ex( age, sales, population)

#Converting to Factors

**Factor** variables are **categorical** variables that can be either numeric or string variables

```{r}
df$Origin[1:20]
class(df$Origin)
unique(df$Origin)
```

Since Origin appears to have categorical values of **IAH** and **HOU** only then convert to Factor
Examine also DayOfWeek  and Month as possible factors. 

```{r include=TRUE}
df$Origin <- as.factor(df$Origin)
class(df$Origin)
```

---
#Categorical Variables as Bar Plots

```{r}
plot(df$Origin)
```

---


```{r}
summary(df)
```

add describe() here


---
#Univariate analysis

In univariate analysis, the output is a single variable and all data collected is for it. There is no cause-and-effect relationship at all

## Charts to use

- Categorical ( Bar , Pie Charts)
- Quantitative (Histogram, BoxPlot, DensityPlot)

---
```{r echo=FALSE}
df$DayOfWeek <- as.factor(df$DayOfWeek)
df$Month <- as.factor(df$Month)
df$UniqueCarrier <- as.factor(df$UniqueCarrier)
```

#Categorical Variables

.pull-left[
```{r}
plot(df$Month)

```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
 plot(df$DayOfWeek)
```

]
---
#Categorical Variables
```{r}
 plot(df$UniqueCarrier)
```


---
#Quantitative Variables



.pull-left[
```{r}
hist(df$DepDelay)

```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
 hist(df$ArrDelay)
```

#BiVariate Analysis

Bivariate analysis refers to the analysis of two variables to determine **relationships** between them. One variable here is dependent while the other is independent. 

###Types of bivariate data analysis

- **Numerical and Numerical** – In this type, both the variables of bivariate data, independent and dependent, - are having numerical values.

- **Categorical and Categorical** – When both the variables are categorical.

- **Numerical and Categorical** – When one variable is numerical and one is categorical.

---

Numerical and Numerical
```{r }
# Get only flights from American Airlines
AA <- subset(hflights, UniqueCarrier == "AA" )
plot(x= AA$ArrDelay , y= AA$DepDelay,  xlab = "Arrival Delay",  ylab = "Departure Delay", col = "dodgerblue1")
```
---
Numerical and Categorical
```{r}
plot(AA$ArrDelay ~ AA$DayOfWeek , xlab = "Day of Week",  ylab = "Arrival Delay", col = "dodgerblue1")
```
---
Categorical and Categorical

```{r}
plot(as.factor(df$DayOfWeek) ~ as.factor(df$Origin))

```
